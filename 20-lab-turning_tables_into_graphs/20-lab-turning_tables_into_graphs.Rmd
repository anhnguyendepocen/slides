** Inspiration for this lab comes from the work of Jonathan Tannen 

##  Goals for Today

1. Understand the value of and practice pair programming
2. Explain why regression graphs are better than tables
3. Code regression tables into graphs

## What is Pair Programming?  
- It has been shown to cut down coding errors by 50 percent!  
- It leads to more efficient, better commented, more elegant code! 
- It is an advanced technique that has taken over the cultures of Facebook, Square, and other Silicon Valley leaders resulting in cleaner more excellent code!  
- It has been said to lead to "soulmate-level" connections!  

## What is Pair Programming?  
- The idea is simple: you code in a team of 2.  
- The Driver: Writes the code.  
- The Navigator: Reviews and guides.  
- Switch often! (At least every 30 minutes)  
- Check in!  
- Reflect on good ways to solve the problems!  

## Why Turn Tables into Graphs? {.smaller}
 
Kastellec and Leoni (2007)

Abstract

> When political scientists present empirical results, they are much more likely to use tables than graphs, despite the fact that <span style="color:blue">**graphs greatly increases the clarity of presentation and makes it easier for a reader to understand the data being used and to draw clear and correct inferences**</span>. Using a sample of leading journals, we document this tendency and suggest reasons why researchers prefer tables. We argue that <span style="color:blue">**the extra work required in producing graphs is rewarded by greatly enhanced presentation and communication of empirical results**</span>. We illustrate their benefits by turning several published tables into graphs, including tables that present descriptive data and regression results. We show that <span style="color:blue">**regression graphs emphasize point estimates and confidence intervals**</span> and that they can successfully present the results of regression models. A move away from tables towards graphs would improve the discipline's communicative output and make empirical findings more accessible to every type of audience.

## Turning Tables into Graphs {.smaller}

*  Turn the table from figure 7 into a graph with ggplot2 (instead of base R) and add color
* Turn the table from figure 8 into a graph with ggplot2 and add color 
* Kastellec and Leoni (2007) code: http://tables2graphs.com/doku.php?id=04_regression_coefficients
    + You can use the code from the link above to retrieve the numbers and variable names you will use.  
    + How can you make the Kastellec and Leoni (2007) code robust to changes in model specification (hint: broom package)?   
<br>
* Complete these tasks while pair programming 
* You both can search for information or help, but you should use the pair programming practices while writing all code. 
* Either replicate the graphs Kastellec and Leoni (2007) made or come up with your own improved graphs to better represent the data. 
* The graphs do not need to look identical. Work on ways can you approve on them, but still retain the same basic information.

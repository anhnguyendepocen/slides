## Goals for Today 


- Run a logistic regression.
- Interpret the coefficients of a logistic regression.
- Predict values and marginal effects of logistic regression.

## HS Graduation

- Use the data located at:
http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Applied-Regression-2E/datasets/HS-Powers.txt  
- Calculate the mean of hsgrad for the two groups of mother
graduated/mother didn't graduate.  
- Calculate the odds of hs graduation for these groups.  
- Calculate the log-odds of hs graduation for these groups.  
- Make a scatter of hsgrad as a function of asvab. Add a loess
fit.  
- Run a linear probability model for hsgrad as a function of
asvab. Add the line to the plot.  
- Plot the residuals from the linear probability model.  

## One-Variable Logistic Regression

$$  Y_i \sim binom(\pi_i) $$
$$  logit(\pi_i) = log\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \alpha + \beta X_i $$

- Run a logistic regression of hsgrad on asvab.
- Does increasing asvab increase or decrease hsgrad?
- Write the equation for the odds of graduating. How does an
increase of 1 in asvab change the odds of graduating?
- Add the fitted values to your original scatter.
- According to the plot, what is the marginal effect of asvab on
probability?
- Plot the residuals vs asvab. What's up?

## Multivariate Logistic Regression
$$   Y_i \sim binom(\pi_i) $$
$$  logit(\pi_i)  = \alpha + \beta_1 asvab_i + \beta_2 mhs_i $$

- Run the regression.
- By hand, write the equation for logit($\pi$). Then, write the
equation for the odds of $Y_i$ . Finally, write the equation for $\pi_i$.
- Interpret the coefficients: How does a change in 1 of asvab
change the odds? Ditto for mhs?
- Add the fitted values from your regression to the plot.

## Multivariate Logistic Regression

- Calculate the odds of graduating if you had a mother who
graduated highschool and got an asvab score of 1. Then the
predicted probability of graduating.
- Write a function that takes a vector of log odds and returns
the probability. (call it inv.logit)

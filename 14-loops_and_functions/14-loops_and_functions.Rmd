** Inspiration for this lab comes from the work of Jonathan Tannen 

##  Goals for Today

1. Using random draws.
2. Use for loops.
3. Create a function.

## R Commands for Today

- FunctionName <- function(arg1, arg2, ...){ } ## Creates function.
- vcov(lm) ## Provides the variance, covariance of the coefficients of a model.
- mvrnorm(n, mu, Sigma) ## Draws values from a multivariate normal distribution.

## "Advances in Development Reverse Fertility Declines" {.smaller}

- The paper examined the relationship between the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in 143 countries.    
- Download: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/extref/nature08230-s2.zip    
- Open a new R Script, set it up, and read.csv the data. We will only be using 2005 data today.   
- Install the package "MASS" with "install.packages("MASS")" and load the MASS, dplyr, boom, and ggplot2 packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("MASS") 
library(MASS)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(broom)
df <- read.csv("data/nature08230-s2.csv")
df <- select(df, country, HDI.2005, TFR.2005)
df <- filter(df, !is.na(HDI.2005), !is.na(TFR.2005))
df <- tbl_df(df)
df
```


## Linear Regression

- Make a scatter plot of TFR and HDI for 2005.
- Regress TFR on HDI in 2005.
- Add the regression line to your plot.   
- Use 'vcov' to examine the variance-covariance of the
coefficients 
- Draw a sample of 100 coefficients from this distribution (using
mvrnorm(), from package MASS).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vcov(lfit)

mvrnorm(1, mu = lfit$coefficients, Sigma = vcov(lfit))


```




## Introduction to loops {.build} {.smaller}

Example from The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design by Normal Matloff  
  
- for (n in x){  
  
- "This means that there will be one iteration of the loop for each component of the vector x, with n taking on the values of those components - in the first iteration, n = x[1]; in the second iternation, n = x[2]; and so on." (p. 140)


```{r}
x <- c(5, 12, 13)
for (n in x){
  print( n ^ 2)
}

```

## Introduction to loops 

```{r}
for (i in 1:10){
  print("Hello world!")
  print(i*i)
}

```


## Introduction to loops {.build} {.smaller}

- If you want to store the values that you create in a vector, you need to set up a vector OUTSIDE OF YOUR LOOP to store the values in before starting your loop. (ex. sqr.squared <- NULL)    

https://blog.udemy.com/r-tutorial/

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sqr <-  seq(1, 100, by=2) # generating sequences of 50 numbers
head(sqr)
sqr.squared <- NULL  ## setting up empty vector
for (n in 1:50) {
sqr.squared[n] <- sqr[n]^2
}

head(sqr.squared)
head(cbind(sqr, sqr.squared))
```


## Practicing for Loops
- Make a scatter plot for TFR and HDI for 2005 using the "plot()"" function 
- Add a line to your scatter plot with the first set of sampled coefficients using "abline()."
(Make it general, rather than typing the coefficients into your script by hand).
- Use a for loop to repeat the above command for every pair of coefficients.

## Introduction to functions {.build} {.smaller}

- Basic set up for functions:
- function.name <- function(arguments) {  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose of function (i.e. computations involving the arguments)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }  
- "{" indicates the beginning of the function, "}" the end


http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/library/intro_function.htm  

```{r}

# Creating a function, called f1, which adds a pair of numbers.
f1 <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

f1(3, 4)
f1(2, 6)
```


## Introduction to functions {.build} {.smaller}

- Basic set up for functions:
- function.name <- function(arguments) {  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose of function (i.e. computations involving the arguments)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }  

```{r}

my.scatter.plot <- function(color, size = 2, method) { # set default size to 2
  ggplot(df, aes(x = HDI.2005, y =  TFR.2005)) + 
    geom_point(color = color, size = size) +   # color and size vary based on inputs
    geom_smooth(method = method, color = "red") + # line will always be red
    theme_bw()                                    # theme will always be bw
}

# my.scatter.plot(color = "green", size = 6,  method = "lm")
# my.scatter.plot(color = "blue",  method = "lm")
# my.scatter.plot("red", 5, "loess")

```

## functions

- Now, write a set of commands that calculates the RMSE for
the first pair of coefficients.
(There are many steps! You need to calculate predicted
values, then find residuals, then calculate RMSE)
- We will want to perform these steps many times, so make this
a function.
- ONLY AFTER YOU'VE WRITTEN YOUR OWN:

Logisitcs:

- please ignore travis-ci stuff for now
- we are going to leave a lot of time for discussion in class today

questions?

At the end of this class you will be able to

- explain why obsession with p-values is worse than useless
- describe simple alternatives that are more interesting


# what are p-values?

##

All p-values do is summarize the data with respect to a null/nil hypothesis

## 

As described in Cohen (!994) p-values are often misinterpreted.  But, this is not my main concern with p-values.

Even if correctly interpreted, p-values

- remove foucs from data, measurement, and theory (e.g., units)
- encourage dichotomous thinking
- lead to filtering of findings in journals based an arbitrary cut-off

# p-hacking

##

"p-hacking is trying multiple things until you get the desired result"

Uri Simonsohn in [Nuzzo (2014)](http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700)

researcher degrees of freedom and distorted incentives are a bad combination

# What should you do?

## 

"don't look for a magical alternative to null hypothesis signficance testing, some other objective mechanical ritual to replace it.  It does not exist."

Cohen (1994)

But I think we can do better

# three simple rules to help move beyond p-values

## 1) Don't talk about p-values

compare:

- "the coefficient on education was significant at the 0.05 level" 

- "Other things being equal, an additional year of education would increase your annual income by $1,500 on average, plus or minus about $500."

- "People who more education earned more money.  Someone with one more year of education than someone else would be expected to earn about $1,500 more per year, plus or minus about $500."


## 2) talk about (and graph) confidence intervals

focuses attention on magnitude and interpretability, and still allows you to rule out 0 

## 3) talk about (and graph) more interesting summaries of complex models

Is there an inverse-U shaped relationship between age and voting?

and there are many more examples in the paper

# one not simple rule to move beyond p-values

##

Focus on prediction

##

the search for statistically significant relationships may be the best way to try to really explain what is happening in the world

Focus on out of sample prediction is related to concerns about p-hacking

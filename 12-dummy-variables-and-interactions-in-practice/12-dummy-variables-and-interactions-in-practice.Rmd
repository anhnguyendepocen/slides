After this class you will be able to 

- 

##



## 

- "include interaction terms whenever they have conditional hypotheses"


##

- "include all constitutive terms when specifying multiplicative interaction models except in very rare circumstances"

##

- "do not interpret consitutive terms as if they are unconditional marginal effects"

##

- "calculate substantively meaning marginal effects and standard errors"

$$\begin{eqnarray}

Why are there 18 race/ethnicity dummy variables and 19 race/ethnicity groups studied?


- omitted group (whites) is measured by intercept $\beta_0$

If a person was a white man what would the model look like?

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
log(inc_{i}) &=& \beta_0 + \nonumber \\
& & \epsilon_i
\end{eqnarray}$$

## { .build }

If the person was a white female what would like the model look like?

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
log(inc_{i}) &=& \beta_0 + \nonumber \\
& & \beta_{19} female_i + \nonumber \\
& & \epsilon_i
\end{eqnarray}$$

## { .build }

If a person was a Chinese-American man what would the model look like?

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
log(inc_{i}) &=& \beta_0 + \nonumber \\
& & \beta_1 Chinese_i + \nonumber \\
& & \epsilon_i
\end{eqnarray}$$

## { .build }

If the person was a Chiniese-American female what would like the model look like?

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
log(inc_{i}) &=& \beta_0 + \nonumber \\
& & \beta_1 Chinese_i + \nonumber \\
& & \beta_{19} female_i + \nonumber \\

Interpret column 6 in words.

- "The effect of gender is always weaker among minorities than whites"
- predicted incomes for women in 18 non-white race/ethnicity groups are higher in a model that includes an interaction term than in a model that does not include an interaction term


## 
How would this pattern be visable in the residuals of this model?

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
log(inc_{i}) &=& \beta_0 + \nonumber \\
& & \beta_1 Chinese_i + \beta_2 Asian Indian + . . . + \beta_{18} Native American + \nonumber \\
& & \beta_{19} female_i + \nonumber \\
& & \epsilon_i
\end{eqnarray}$$

Hint: Here's the full model
$$\begin{eqnarray} 
log(inc_{i}) &=& \beta_0 + \nonumber \\
& & \beta_1 Chinese_i + \beta_2 Asian Indian + . . . + \beta_{18} Native American + \nonumber \\
& & \beta_{19} female_i + \nonumber \\
& & \beta_{20} Chinese_i * female_i + \beta_{21} Asian Indian * female_i +  . . .  + \nonumber \\
& & \epsilon_i
\end{eqnarray}$$

How much does this increase how much you believe this result?

How must their code be organized in order to be able to run these checks reliably?

Hint: Use this picture to help structure your thoughts and language.

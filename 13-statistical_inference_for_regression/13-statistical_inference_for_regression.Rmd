##

Logisitcs:
- next two weeks posted
- no more assignments before spring break, only work on your project

##

Plan for this week:
- statistical inference from regression
- loops and functions
- beyond stargazing (many of my collogues might not agree with this class)

After this class you will be able to

- look up in a book the assumptions required for a variety of properties of the least-squares estimator
- describe the difference between empirical and structural relationships
- explain the consequences of measurement error on the outcome variable and predictor variables

#

assumptions related to regression

##

Data generating process:
\begin{equation}
Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}

Given lots of pairs $$(x, y)$$ what we can infer about $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$?  This must require assumptions.

##

Variety of assumptions
- linearity
- contstant variance
- normality
- independence
- fixed X or X measured wihtout error and indepednent of the error

Lead to variety of properties
- unbiased estimators
- specific sampling variance
- most efficent of all linear estimators
- maximum liklihood estimators
- coefficents are normally distributed

##

Consider the case
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$$

Many of the assumptions are about relationship between $X$ and $\epsilon$.

And, these can be checked, see Fox Chapter 12: Diagnosing non-normality, nonconstant error variance, and nonlinearity.

##

How you might have thought before:
- your p-values = f(your data)

How I hope you think now:
- your p-values = f(your data, your assumptions)

# 

What about a census?

##

Think back to your homework that involved the 50 US States.  Do these assumptions make sense in that case?

measurement error on outcome and predictors

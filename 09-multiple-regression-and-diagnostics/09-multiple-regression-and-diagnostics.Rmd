After this class you will be able to 

- explain what is a regression line and what is a residual is words, equations, and pictures
- explain the relationship between a regression coefficient and a correlation coefficent in words, equations, and pictures
- compare and contrast extrapolation and interpolation
- compare and contrast outliers, leverage, and influence

Last class we did this with single predictor model and now we are going to do it with two predictor models.

##

To make things concrete, we will talk about the relationship between education, father's education, and income.

##

What is a regression plane and what is a residual is words, equations, and pictures?

##

Here is some data from the GSS.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
load("data/gss_2010_training.RData")
gss.training <- tbl_df(gss.training)
gss <- select(gss.training, income06_n, educ, maeduc, paeduc) %>%
  filter(!is.na(income06_n), !is.na(educ), !is.na(maeduc), !is.na(paeduc))
# NOTE: DROPPING MISSING DATA LIKE THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS
gss <- rename(gss, income = income06_n)
```

## 

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(GGally))
pm <- ggpairs(select(gss, educ, paeduc, income))
pm
```

##

```{r}
library(scatterplot3d)
```

##

```{r}
scatterplot3d(x=gss$educ, y=gss$paeduc, z=gss$income, 
              xlab="Education", ylab="Father's education", 
              zlab="Income category", pch=20, angle=20)
```

##

```{r}
scatterplot3d(x=gss$educ, y=gss$paeduc, z=gss$income, 
              xlab="Education", ylab="Father's education", 
              zlab="Income category", pch=20, angle=40)
```

##

```{r}
scatterplot3d(x=gss$educ, y=gss$paeduc, z=gss$income, 
              xlab="Education", ylab="Father's education", 
              zlab="Income category", pch=20, angle=60)
```

##

```{r}
scatterplot3d(x=gss$educ, y=gss$paeduc, z=gss$income, 
              xlab="Education", ylab="Father's education", 
              zlab="Income category", pch=20, angle=80)
```

##

now let's add the regression plane

##

```{r}
s3d <- scatterplot3d(x=gss$educ, y=gss$paeduc, z=gss$income, 
              xlab="Education", ylab="Father's education", 
              zlab="Income category", pch=20, angle=20)
my.lm <- lm(gss$income ~ gss$educ + gss$paeduc)
s3d$plane3d(my.lm)
```

##

```{r}
s3d <- scatterplot3d(x=gss$educ, y=gss$paeduc, z=gss$income, 
              xlab="Education", ylab="Father's education", 
              zlab="Income category", pch=20, angle=40)
my.lm <- lm(gss$income ~ gss$educ + gss$paeduc)
s3d$plane3d(my.lm)
```

##

```{r}
s3d <- scatterplot3d(x=gss$educ, y=gss$paeduc, z=gss$income, 
              xlab="Education", ylab="Father's education", 
              zlab="Income category", pch=20, angle=60)
my.lm <- lm(gss$income ~ gss$educ + gss$paeduc)
s3d$plane3d(my.lm)
```


##

```{r}
s3d <- scatterplot3d(x=gss$educ, y=gss$paeduc, z=gss$income, 
              xlab="Education", ylab="Father's education", 
              zlab="Income category", pch=20, angle=80)
my.lm <- lm(gss$income ~ gss$educ + gss$paeduc)
s3d$plane3d(my.lm)
```

##

The regression plane is the plane that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals. The residual is the difference between the predicted income and actual income for each person in the sample.

$$\mbox{income}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \mbox{educ}_i + \beta_2 \times \mbox{paeduc}_i + \mbox{residual}_i$$ 

$$\widehat{\mbox{income}}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \mbox{educ}_i + \beta_2 \times \mbox{paeduc}_i$$ 


##

As with the line, it is well defined that this is the best fit plane to the whole dataset, but why is that what we want?

## { .smaller }

What is the relationship between a regression coefficient and a correlation coefficent in words, equations, and pictures?

Model is: $$\widehat{\mbox{income}}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \mbox{educ}_i + \beta_2 \times \mbox{paeduc}_i$$ 


$$\beta_1 = \frac{cor(income, educ) - cor(educ, paeduc) \times cor(income, paeduc)}{ (1 - cor(educ, paeduc)^2 ) } \times \frac{SD(income)}{SD(educ)}$$

or 

$$\beta_1 = \frac{cor(income, educ) - cor(educ, paeduc) \times cor(income, paeduc)}{ (1 - cor(educ, paeduc)^2 ) } \times \frac{SD(educ)}{SD(income)}$$

- How can you figure out which is correct?
- Note what happens when educ and paeduc are uncorrelated
- Note what happens when educ and paeduc are correlated
- If you wanted to decrease $\beta_1$ what kind of extra variable should you add to the model?

## { .smaller }

What is the relationship between a regression coefficient and a correlation coefficent in words, equations, and pictures?

```{r}
library(broom)
fit <- lm(income ~ educ + paeduc, data = gss)
tidy(fit)
```

```{r}
numerator <- cor(gss$income, gss$educ) - (cor(gss$educ, gss$paeduc) * cor(gss$income, gss$paeduc))
denominator <- 1 - cor(gss$educ, gss$paeduc)^2
numerator / denominator * (sd(gss$income) / sd(gss$educ))
```
